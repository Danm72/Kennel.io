The internal gaf site



You'll need node.js and bower for this.

Within the app directory run an ```npm install```, and bower install this will install grunt, ember, bootstrap etc all within the packages scope

You'll then want to grunt serve, this usually opens a http://localhost:9000 served version of the site, it will also run jshint and redeploy upon changes
